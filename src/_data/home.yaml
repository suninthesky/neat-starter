  - paragraph:
      Almost every condensing combi boiler in the UK is burning more gas,
      generating more emissions and costing households more than they need to.

      If these boilers were optimised, households could reduce their energy
      use, costs and emissions.
  - paragraph:
      The flow temperature toolkit is a resource for advice givers in the
      energy and home heating sector. It contains guidance, ready to use assets
      and best practice examples of how to ensure boilers are running
