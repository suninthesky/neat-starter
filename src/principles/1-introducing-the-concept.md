## What is it?

There are a number of things to introduce to end-users, these should be tailored to the audience. This pattern focuses on introducing the technical reasoning behind lowering flow temperature, and explaining the possible financial and environmental benefits. And also reassures that comfort won’t be affected.

## Why do it?

Homeowners are often confused about how to heat their homes. Any new information needs to be presented in a manner that builds trust, being transparent about the reasons to make this change to their boiler helps to build this confidence.

Some of the guidance given could seem counterintuitive and technical to some. Introducing the concept and the reasoning behind it helps to reassure that the change is easy to make and possible by anyone. Building this confidence early on whilst introducing the concept builds knowledge to change wider heating habits later in the process. This will ultimately help to ensure that comfort isn’t affected.

By being clear and concise in introducing the concept early on, the advice should have long-term benefits and the changes a greater chance of success.
